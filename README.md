<h1>Vulnerability Management using Nessus </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates how to utilize Nessus to conduct credentialed and non-credentialed vulnerability scans. I installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform both credentialed and non-credentialed vulnerability scans against a Windows 10 host set up on VirtualBox. I utilized Nessus to discover vulnerabilities, prioritize based on CVSS score and function, remediate found vulnerabilities, and verify if the vulnerabilities existed and were properply patched.
